            <h3>The Team</h3>
            <p>We are eight Master's students at EPFL, coming from different sections (Computer Science, Data Science, Life Sciences, Electrical and Electronic Engineering). We came together as part of a Humanities and Social Sciences course, which aims to design and organize an event for the 2025-2026 academic year.</p>
            <p>We therefore created this group, with the objective of creating a stimulating, technical event, but above all one that brings EPFL students together in a fun way in the form of a competition.</p>
            <p>We have also partnered with <strong>LauzHack</strong>, which is the reference association for hackathons at EPFL. This partnership will be particularly useful to us because their expertise in creating this type of event is essential.</p>

        <h2>The ConquerHack Project</h2>
        <p class="intro-text">ConquerHack is a free student initiative aiming to bring together AI, algorithmics, and gaming enthusiasts around a competition where they compete on a game made for the occasion.</p>

                <h3>Hackathon Concept</h3>
                <p>Our Hackathon proposes an innovative concept focused on programming, AI, and algorithmics. Over one to two days, teams of EPFL students will have to develop the best algorithm/IA before having to pit them against those of other teams on a game that we will have created.</p>
                <p>In order to have the most connection with EPFL and to make the competition as fun as possible, we have chosen a campus conquest game. The general goal will be to conquer the different rooms and buildings of EPFL with the commands sent by the algorithms that the students will have created.</p>

            <div class="card">
                <h3>Format</h3>
                <p>Our event will take place on <strong>Saturday and Sunday, March 21 and 22, 2026</strong>, and will bring together between 30 and 50 students. These students will have already formed several teams, up to a maximum of 5 players.</p>
                <p>After a short introduction to the game on Saturday morning, students will be able to program their algorithms until Sunday noon. The competition will then take place on Sunday afternoon. The different teams will be able to see their algorithms compete on a screen that we will have available in the room.</p>

        <div class="content-block mt-2">
            <h3>Participant Profile</h3>
            <p>The profile of the participants will be students already familiar with programming, algorithmics, and artificial intelligence. They will therefore come rather from sections such as Computer Science, Data Science, or Engineering.</p>
            <p>These students are generally very motivated, curious, and used to working on particularly complex projects in groups.</p>
            <p>This audience therefore represents a unique opportunity for our partners to reach or gain visibility with an audience of future engineers, developers, or data scientists.</p>
